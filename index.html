        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><strong class="name">Wardell Stephen Curry</strong> <em>(born in March 16, 1988 in Akron Ohio)</em> is an American professional basketball player for The Golden State Warriors. He grew up immersed in basketball as his father, Dell Curry was an NBA pro and a sharpshooter before Steph's time. Although he came from a basketball family that didn't mean Steph was set for success and had an easy road to the pro's. In fact he had to go through such adversity to get where he is now and be what he is today.    Steph Curry truly changed the game and how it will be played from here on out until it is revolutionized once again. Let us take a look at the things he's done </p>
